# PythonNeuralNetwork
An implementation of a neural network in python, including backpropagation and training.
This is a working example of how a neural network and its training can be implemented in python without the use of tensorflow or similar libraries. In reality, it was implemented as a an exercise in multiple technologies:

pytest for unit testing

python and numpy as a replacement for Matlab

backpropagation in neural networks
